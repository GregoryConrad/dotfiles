- Managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io)
- [Helix](https://helix-editor.com) for text/code editing
  - Used to use neovim, but Helix *just works* with no effort
- Currently experimenting with [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) as my terminal
  - Not a fan that you can't really store your entire config in `~/.warp/`, but I'll live
  - Used to use [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), but wasn't happy with a few things (no splits!)
